        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Strong analytical skills and Research proficiency:</strong> I have gained extensive experience in conducting rigorous research and have developed advanced quantitative and analytical abilities. This enables me to contribute valuable insights to any research project or policy analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Creative thinking:</strong> During my undergraduate stage, while many students tend to rely on their tutors for selecting research titles, I always come up with new ideas when reading literature. I actively discuss these ideas with my supervisor to determine if they are worth researching further.</p>
        <p><strong>Teamwork:</strong> I possess excellent teamwork capabilities. For example, during research class, I often assist other classmates by collecting data or discussing their confusion.</p>
        <p><strong>Persistence:</strong> The most important quality that I possess is persistence. I can accept failure and continue working on a problem until I solve it. I am not a very smart student, but I am a hard-working, self-driven, and persistent student.</p>
